## 3 most critical user flows

### Flow 1: `Login > Websites > Add website`

Since one of the most important function Hostinger provides is website creation, the majority of new users would go through this flow of adding a new website. This flow would then continue to choosing a website builder, creating a new layout and choosing a domain but the core of this critical flow would be through Websites page.

### Flow 2: `Login > Websites > Edit website`

Users usually update their websites quite frequently, there might be a need to add additinal text, new sections or update visuals. So even though it is possible to go to website builder directly via a link, less technical users would click the "Edit website" button. Also, if the user has multiple web pages to update, Websites page would be the most convenient place to start.

### Flow 3: `Login > Emails`

New users would most likely want to create multiple emails for their websites and this flow would lead to plan or mailbox setup. Also, this user flow allows email management and it is quite likely that the user would want to administrate those mailboxes via this page on a regular basis.

**Note:**
`Billing > Subscriptions` could also be an important user flow but since most users would select and pay for a hosting plan without signing up/ logging in before creating a website, it is not a crutial user flow. Also, all subscriptions are billed every 12/ 24/ 48 months and can be auto-renewed, therefore the user would not check that page often.
`Login > Websites > Dashboard > Analytics` could also be a frequently used flow but only for customers with an existing website and fairly advanced technical knowledge.
